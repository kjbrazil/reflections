When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is helpful to use a remote repository when collaborating with other people or sharing work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I may not want the changes that are in the remote repository. Also, it might conflict with some changes that I have already made and do not want those to be overwritten.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches are a line of connected commits.
    Clones are a copy of a repository.
    Forks are a copy of a repository done in Github with connections to the original.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows for an anchor state for which pushing, pulling, and merging can be based off of later.
